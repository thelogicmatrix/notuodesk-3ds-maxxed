# NotuoDesk 3ds Maxxed

A Blender add-on (Blender 4.2+, tested on 5.2.3 LTS) that makes Blender look and work like Autodesk 3ds Max. It's aimed at people who know both apps.

![3ds Max layout in Blender: quad viewports, Command Panel, Editable Poly](docs/quad-editpoly.png)

![Animated Melt modifier at frame 60](docs/melt-animation.png)

## Install

1. In Blender, open **Edit › Preferences › Get Extensions**, click the **⌄** menu (top right), then **Install from Disk…**
2. Pick `notuodesk_3ds_maxxed-1.8.0.zip` (download it from this repo's **Releases** page).
3. On first enable, the add-on applies the 3ds Max theme and adds a **3ds Max** workspace, then switches you to it.

To reset a rearranged layout, choose **Customize › Apply 3ds Max Look**. It rebuilds the "3ds Max" workspace from scratch.

To go back to normal Blender, choose **Customize › Restore Blender Look**, or turn the add-on off. Turning it off removes every hotkey and menu change. The theme stays as it is until you restore it.

## What you get

| 3ds Max | In Blender |
|---|---|
| Menu bar: File, Edit, Tools, Group, Views, Create, Modifiers, Animation, Graph Editors, Rendering, Customize, Scripting, Help | Replaces Blender's top menus. Blender's own menus are still there as sub-menus |
| Workspaces dropdown | Top right, replaces the workspace tabs |
| Main Toolbar | Viewport header: undo/redo, link/unlink, select by name, region select, move/rotate/scale, reference coordinate system, pivot, snaps, mirror, align, editors, render |
| Scene Explorer | Outliner on the left |
| 4 viewports: Top, Front, Left, Perspective | Quad view with clickable `[+] [Top] [Standard] [Edged Faces]` labels, like Max:<br>**[+]** maximize, grid, ViewCube, statistics<br>**[Perspective]** Top / Front / Left… and your cameras<br>**[Standard]** High Quality / Standard / Performance, shadows and AO<br>**[Default Shading]** Default Shading, Shaded Materials with Maps, Flat Color, Clay, Wireframe Override, Realistic, ActiveShade, Edged Faces, See-Through |
| Command Panel: Create, Modify, Hierarchy, Motion, Display, Utilities | Right sidebar with collapsible rollouts |
| Click-drag creation (base first, then height) | Box, Cone, Sphere, GeoSphere, Cylinder, Tube, Torus, Pyramid, Plane. Right-click stops creating |
| Parametric primitives | Length/Width/Height/Segs stay editable in **Parameters** until you convert to Editable Poly or enter sub-object mode |
| Modifier List and stack | About 60 modifiers under their Max names (see below). Newest is on top, with a visibility toggle per modifier |
| Editable Poly | Selection, Edit Vertices/Edges/Borders/Polygons/Elements and Edit Geometry rollouts |
| Quad menus | Right-click (display / tools / transform) and Ctrl+right-click (modeling) |
| Status bar | "1 Object Selected", X/Y/Z type-in, Grid, Auto Key, Set Key |
| Look | Max dark UI, cyan selection outline, red sub-object selection, blue vertices, random object colors, names like Box001 |

## Editable Poly

The Modify tab has Max's Selection, Soft Selection, Edit Vertices, Edit Edges,
Edit Borders, Edit Polygons, Edit Elements and Edit Geometry rollouts. Material
IDs and the 32 Smoothing Groups appear at Polygon and Element levels. Subdivision
Surface is available at every level. Adding Edit Poly still edits the base mesh.

The small settings button beside an operation opens its options. Click OK to
apply them. The main button reuses the accepted values for that operation and
sub-object level. Values live in the scene and are saved in the blend file.

Material IDs use Blender's material slots, numbered from 1. Smoothing groups use
the face attribute `max_smoothing_group`, including group 32. Faces that share a
group have smooth common edges. Other edges become sharp. Auto Smooth assigns
groups by face angle. Crease writes Blender's native vertex or edge crease.
Use NURMS Subdivision adds a native Subdivision Surface modifier. Smooth Result
backs up and restores face shading, as TurboSmooth does.

Ring and Loop have shift arrows. At Border level, Select Open Edges finds the
mesh boundaries. Quad Cap and Loop Regularizer appear when their companion
operators are installed. Disabled controls explain the Blender limitation in
their tooltip.

Headless checks run with an isolated Blender profile:

```powershell
& 'C:/Program Files/Blender Foundation/Blender 5.0/blender.exe' -b --factory-startup --python-exit-code 1 --python tests/test_editable_poly_panel.py
```

Set `BLENDER_USER_SCRIPTS`, `BLENDER_USER_CONFIG` and `BLENDER_USER_EXTENSIONS`
to your test profile first. Its scripts/addons directory must contain this add-on.

## Compact Material Editor (M)

<img src="docs/material-editor.png" width="207" align="right" alt="Compact Material Editor">

Press **M**, or choose **Rendering › Material Editor**. It opens as a narrow floating window, like 3ds Max's Compact Material Editor.

- **Sample slots:** 6, 15 or 24 slots, or **All**, chosen under Options. A dot marks materials that are used in the scene. **+ New Slot** adds more slots, with no 24-slot limit. **Utils › Get All Scene Materials** loads every material used in the scene, adding slots as needed.
- **Drag and drop:** click a slot's hand icon, or **Drag**, then click an object in any viewport.
  - **Plain click:** replaces the object's material, as in Max.
  - **Object is part of a selection:** assigns to every selected object.
  - **Edit Mode:** assigns to the selected faces.
  - **Ctrl+click:** replaces only the material on the part you clicked.
  - **Shift+click:** keeps dropping. Right-click or Esc to stop.
  - *Blender doesn't let add-on buttons start a true mouse drag, so it works as pick-up-and-click.*
- **Side toolbar:** preview type (sphere, cube, flat, cloth…), **Select by Material**, and options.
- **Bottom toolbar:** Get Material, **Assign Material to Selection**, Reset Map/Mtl to Default Settings, Make Material Copy, **Put to Library** (Asset Browser), Material ID Channel, and Show Shaded Material in Viewport.
- **Pick Material from Object:** an eyedropper. Click any object, or one face of a multi-material object.
- **Material type:** Standard, VRayMtl or Physical.
- **Rollouts:**
  - **Shader Basic Parameters:** Blinn, Phong, Metal, Anisotropic, Oren-Nayar-Blinn, Translucent and Multi-Layer, plus Wire, 2-Sided and Faceted.
  - **Blinn Basic Parameters:** Ambient (locked), Diffuse, Specular, Self-Illumination, Opacity, Specular Level, Glossiness and Soften.
  - **Extended Parameters.**
  - **Maps:** per-channel on/off and a bitmap button for Diffuse, Specular, Glossiness, Self-Illum, Opacity, Bump (with amount), Reflection, Refraction and Displacement.
- **New materials** start with 3ds Max's defaults: grey 150, Specular Level 0, Glossiness 10.
- **Real materials:** every value drives the material's Principled BSDF directly, so it renders the same in EEVEE, Cycles, and V-Ray (after conversion).
- **Slate view:** the node canvas behind the panel acts as the Slate editor and shows the active slot's material.

## Opening 3ds Max files

![A 3ds Max 2015 character opened with File › Open 3ds Max File](docs/open-max-file.png)

`.max` is a closed Autodesk format. 3ds Maxxed reads it through the open-source [Import Autodesk MAX (.max)](https://extensions.blender.org/add-ons/io-scene-max/) extension (GPL, [source](https://github.com/nrgsille76/io_scene_max)). If it isn't installed, **File › Import › Install .max Reader…** installs it.

- **File › Open 3ds Max File…** opens the file into a new scene, so nothing in your current scene is overwritten.
- **File › Import › Merge 3ds Max File** adds a file's objects to the current scene. You can also drag a `.max` file onto the viewport.
- **System Units:** pick the unit the file was made in. The default is Inches, 3ds Max's US default. The reader ignores units, so without this setting scenes come in at the wrong scale.
- **Materials:** names are cleaned up (`04 - Default` instead of `04___Default_C:\Users\…\pipe_bowl`), and the materials can be edited in **Modify › Material** using V-Ray parameter names.
- **Textures:** bitmaps are searched for next to the `.max` file and in its subfolders, in any image format. Missing files are listed like Max's *Missing External Files*. Point **File › External Data › Relink 3ds Max Textures…** at the folder where they are. It also matches renamed copies like `Name (1).png`. To pick a file for one material directly, use **Modify › Material › Load Bitmap…**.

**What the reader supports:** meshes (Editable Poly/Mesh), primitives, UVs, Standard / Physical / V-Ray / Corona materials, and helpers. It handles uncompressed files from any version, and compressed files up to 3ds Max 2023. **Not supported:** animation, modifiers (meshes come in collapsed), splines, lights, cameras and rigs.

**For full scenes, use FBX:** run [`tools/max_to_blender.ms`](tools/max_to_blender.ms) inside 3ds Max (*Scripting › Run Script*). It exports the open scene, or a whole folder of `.max` files, to FBX. Then use **File › Import › FBX from 3ds Max** in Blender, which keeps animation, skinning, cameras and lights, and turns TurboSmooth into subdivision. *(I haven't been able to test the MAXScript, since 3ds Max isn't available here.)*

## Modifiers

### TurboSmooth

![TurboSmooth on the Captain](docs/turbosmooth.png)

TurboSmooth is in the Modifier List, the quad menus (right-click and Ctrl+right-click) and the Command Panel. It uses 3ds Max's parameters:
- **Main:** Iterations (default 1), Render Iters, Isoline Display, Explicit Normals.
- **Surface Parameters:** Smooth Result, and Separate by **Materials** / **Smoothing Groups**. These keep material borders and sharp edges crisp by creasing them.
- **Update Options:** Always / When Rendering. When Rendering keeps the viewport light.

Underneath it's Blender's native Subdivision Surface, so it keeps GPU subdivision in the viewport.


**Built for this add-on** (Geometry Nodes, because Blender has no equivalent):
**Melt** (Amount, % of Melt Spread, Solidity with Ice/Glass/Jelly/Plastic presets, Irregularity, Drip Size, Seed, Flip Axis). Click **Animate Melt** to keyframe it from solid to puddle over a frame range, or key Amount yourself with Auto Key (N), the key button, or right-click › Insert Keyframe, **Skew**, **Squeeze**, **Slice**, **Noise**, **Push**, **Spherify**.

**FFD 2x2x2 / 3x3x3 / 4x4x4 / FFD Box** create an orange cage fitted to the object, with 3ds Max's FFD parameters:
- **Sub-Object:** **Control Points** (edit the cage), **Lattice** (move, rotate or scale it), **Back to Object**.
- **Set Number of Points:** L × W × H.
- **Display:** Lattice, In Front.
- **Deform:** **Only In Volume** / **All Vertices** with **Falloff**, plus Interpolation (B-Spline, Catmull-Rom, Cardinal, Linear) and Strength.
- **Control Points:** **Reset**, **Animate All** (keys every point), **Conform to Shape** (Inside / Outside Points, Offset).
- **Fit to Object** and **Update Volume.** Run Update Volume after moving the cage when using Only In Volume or Falloff.

**Modifier List:** type to search and press Enter. The list stays open until you choose. The ≡ button opens a compact menu of categories.

**Mapped to Blender's own modifiers:** Edit Poly, Symmetry, Mirror, Vertex Weld, ProOptimizer, Optimize, MultiRes, Turn to Mesh, Delete Mesh, Smooth, Edit Normals, Weighted Normals, Retopology, Quadify Mesh, TurboSmooth, MeshSmooth, OpenSubdiv, Tessellate, Subdivide, HSDS, Shell, Chamfer, Array, Boolean, ProBoolean, Lattice, Skin, Displace, Bend, Twist, Taper, Stretch, Relax, Smooth Deform, Wave, Ripple, Affect Region, Shrink Wrap, Conform, Path Deform, Skin Wrap, Skin Morph, Skin (bones), Linked XForm, UVW Map, Unwrap UVW, UVW XForm, Extrude, Lathe, Sweep, Cloth, Flex, Point Cache, Particle Flow, Hair and Fur, and Ocean.

## V-Ray

- **If Chaos V-Ray for Blender is installed** (there is a free Community Edition), it's detected automatically. **Rendering › V-Ray › Renderer: V-Ray** makes it the active renderer, and the same menu lists V-Ray's own tools.
- **Without V-Ray installed**, you still get the V-Ray workflow, rendered in Cycles:
  - **VRayMtl**: Default, Glossy Plastic, Brushed Metal, Chrome, Glass, Car Paint, VRayLightMtl. Edit it in Modify › Material using V-Ray parameter names (Diffuse, Reflect, Refl. Glossiness, Metalness, Fresnel IOR, Refract, Opacity, Coat, Self-Illumination).
  - **VRayLight**: Plane, Disc, Sphere, Dome (choose an HDRI), plus VRaySun with VRaySky, and VRayIES.
  - **VRayPhysicalCamera**: film gate, focal length, F-number, shutter speed and ISO drive scene exposure. f/8, 1/200 s and ISO 100 count as 0 EV.
  - **VRayPlane**: an effectively infinite ground plane.
  - **Quality presets** (Draft, Medium, High, Very High) use progressive sampling with a noise limit and the denoiser.
- These objects are standard Blender lights, cameras and Principled materials, so V-Ray for Blender's Cycles-to-V-Ray conversion can handle them. I couldn't test that conversion because V-Ray isn't installed on the test machine.

## Known differences from 3ds Max

- Editable Poly's By Vertex click filter, Ignore Backfacing, hover Preview
  Selection, topology Constraints and Preserve UVs channel settings are disabled.
  By Angle expands the current face selection with a separate button.
- Soft Selection uses Blender proportional editing for transforms. Edge Distance
  means connected-only, with no edge-count cutoff. Falloff is Blender's radius.
  Pinch, Bubble, Affect Backfacing and a custom curve preview are unavailable.
  Fixed-value mesh operations do not use proportional influence.
- Hinge From Edge, Extrude Along Spline and hidden Edit Triangulation are disabled.
  Turn rotates real edges and Retriangulate creates real triangles. Remove Unused
  Map Verts is disabled because Blender stores UVs on face corners.
- Extrude uses Blender region or individual-face extrusion. Vertex extrusion
  creates wire edges. Edge extrusion uses the average selected surface normal,
  with local Z as the fallback. Extrusion Base Width is disabled. Chamfer Tension
  maps to Blender's bevel profile, so intermediate shapes differ from Max.
- Bridge uses Blender edge-loop bridging. Taper and Bias scale intermediate
  rings with a linear envelope, which can differ from Max. Smooth sets the new
  bridge edges by face angle. Existing smoothing groups take precedence.
  Connect subdivides selected edges or connects vertices. Its Pinch and Slide
  settings are disabled. MSmooth uses native smooth subdivision, not NURMS.
- Create fills the selected vertices instead of picking vertices in the viewport.
  Insert Vertex splits selected edges at their midpoint, or pokes selected faces.
  Create Shape From Selection copies each selected edge to a separate poly spline.
  Target Weld uses the active vertex rather than a viewport target picker.
- Slice Plane uses numeric local coordinates without Max's plane gizmo. QuickSlice
  uses Blender's interactive bisect. Ring and Loop shifts use quad topology and
  Blender's face/vertex order, so direction can differ on irregular meshes.
  Named Selections Copy/Paste stores one selection per mesh and sub-object level.
- Weight and Subdivision Surface Smoothness are disabled because Blender's
  subdivision has no equivalent. NURMS uses a live Subdivision Surface modifier.
  Auto Smooth supports up to 32 disconnected smooth patches in one operation.

- Blender keeps one shading mode per viewport *area*, so all four quads share the same shading (Max can set it per viewport).
- There's no Teapot, ViewCube or Ribbon. Blender's navigation gizmo stands in for the ViewCube.
- Shift-drag cloning isn't supported. Use Ctrl+V (Clone), or Blender's Shift+D.
- Entering a sub-object level on a primitive converts it straight to Editable Poly; in Max you would add an Edit Poly modifier instead.

## Updating

From 1.5.0 on, the add-on can update itself from this repo's GitHub Releases. Use **Customize › Check for Updates**, **Utilities › NotuoDesk 3ds Maxxed** in the Command Panel, or the add-on's preferences.

- If a newer release exists, **Update to x.y.z** downloads it and installs it over the current version in one click.
- It checks on startup by default. You can turn that off in the preferences.
- Blender's **Preferences › System › Network › Allow Online Access** has to be on.
- **While the repo is private,** paste a GitHub token into the add-on preferences (**GitHub Token**). Create a *fine-grained* token at GitHub › Settings › Developer settings › Personal access tokens. Limit it to this repository, with **Contents: Read-only** access. The token is stored in Blender's preferences file. If the repo is public, no token is needed.
- **Publishing an update:** bump `version` in `blender_manifest.toml`, build the zip, and attach it to a new GitHub Release tagged `vX.Y.Z`.
